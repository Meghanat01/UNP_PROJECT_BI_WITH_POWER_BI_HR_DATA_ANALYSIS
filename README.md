#HR ATTRITION ANALYSIS
**TITLE OF THE PROJECT: HR Analysis on Employee Attrition.**

I completed a PowerBI project in collaboration with UNP where I performed an in-depth HR Analytics study focused on understanding employee attrition and the key factors influencing workforce stability. This project analyzed a real-world employee dataset and explored patterns across demographics, job roles, compensation, performance, and career progression. Using Power BI, I built multiple interactive dashboards that provided insights into why employees leave, which departments and roles are most affected, and how organizational policies impact retention.The project highlights major attrition drivers such as overtime, job satisfaction, business travel frequency, salary variations, and lack of promotions. It also examines tenure trends, training effectiveness, and compensation gaps to uncover hidden workforce risks.The goal of this analysis was to help organizations make data-driven HR decisions that improve employee well-being, increase retention, and strengthen workforce planning. The dashboards created offer a clear visual story that HR leaders can use for strategic interventions and policy improvements.I would like to sincerely thank UNP for their continuous help, support, and guidance throughout this project. Their learning resources, mentorship, and collaborative environment played a key role in successfully completing this HR Analytics project.Overall, this project demonstrates the power of analytics in identifying HR challenges and enabling actionable recommendations through data visualization and insights.
